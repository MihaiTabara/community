# [Permission Framework](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/OWNERS.md#permission-framework)

## Backlog

The permission framework maintainers will use this space as a way to keep track
of upcoming work that we'd like to tackle regarding the permission framework. The
presence of an item on this backlog does not guarantee that that piece of work
will be tackled, nor does it guarantee any timeframe around which we commit to
tackling the work. We hope that this lightweight backlog serves our needs, but
are happy to reasses the way of working as needs grow!

* Provide a better API for aggregating all permissions within a given Backstage instance.
* Improve relationship between `catalog.entity.delete` permission and the `catalog.location.delete` permission.
* Bring the permission framework to 1.0 stability
* General solution for permissioned routes / permissioned plugin views
