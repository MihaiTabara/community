# [Core Maintainers](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/OWNERS.md#core-maintainers)

Note that this document does not relate to a distinct project area, but instead
the Backstage core maintainers team.

## Ways of Working

### Issue Triage

The core maintainers use the
[regularly scheduled sync](../Maintainer-Guidance.md#regularly-scheduled-sync)
issue triage strategy. Every Monday and Thursday the core maintainers meet to
walk through all issues with recent changes, as well as any pull request marked
with the `needs-discussion` label.

This meeting is not currently open to external participation.

### Pull Request Reviews

The core maintainers use the
[randomized pull request assignment](../Maintainer-Guidance.md#randomized-pull-request-assignment)
pull request review strategy. All incoming pull requests are distributed
randomly and evenly among the maintainers.
